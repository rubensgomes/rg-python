# Justification For Project

I have created the "rg-python" project as a fun and playground project to practice and learn
python and PyDev from within Eclipse IDE.

## PyDev Common Shortcuts to Remember

### Creating

- ALT+SHIFT+N: create project, package, module

### Editing

- SHIFT+ENTER: move to the next line
- CNTRL+TAB  : to move back from class to its consumer
- CNTRL+1    : add docstring, assign class to variable, create local variable

### Refactoring

- ALT+SHIFT+I: inlining a variable
- ALT+SHIFT+L: extracting a variable
- ALT+SHIFT+M: moving code to new function
- ALT+SHIFT+R: renaming variable, function, class, file

### Running, Testing, and Debugging

- F9        : run the selected code
- SHIFT+F9  : debug current file
- CNTRL+F9  : run unit test on selected function
